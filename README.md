lsCOMP (<u>l</u>ight <u>s</u>ource <u>COMP</u>ression) is a user-friendly and fast GPU lossy/lossless compressor for light source data and unsigned integers (both ```uint32``` and ```uint16```).
Both compression and decompression in lsCOMP is fully executed in a single NVIDIA GPU kernel without CPU intervention, guaranteeing high end-to-end performance.
Supporting both configurable lossy and lossless compression modes, lsCOMP can be used in diverse scenarios that require different level of data fidelity.
lsCOMP is not only suitable for light source data but also for generic integer compression that requres high speed (e.g., visualization datasets from [Open Scivis Datasets](https://github.com/sci-visus/open-scivis-datasets)).

## Environmental Requirements
- Linux OS with NVIDIA GPUs
- Git >= 2.15
- CMake >= 3.21
- CUDA Toolkit >= 11.0
- GCC >= 7.3.0

## Compile lsCOMP
You can compile lsCOMP by following commands:
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/szcompressor/lsCOMP.git
$ cd lsCOMP
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make -j
```
After compilation, you will see 2 executable binaries, ```lsCOMP_uint32``` and ```lsCOMP_uint16```, in ```lsCOMP/build/```.
They are used for performing either configurable lossy or lossless compression for ```uint32``` and ```uint16``` data.

## Execute lsCOMP
We use ```lsCOMP_uint32``` here to explain; the usage of ```lsCOMP_uint16``` is similar.
```shell
$ ./lsCOMP_uint32 --help
lsCOMP Usage:
   ./lsCOMP_uint32 -i oriFilePath -d dims.x dims.y dims.z -b quantBins.x quantBins.y quantBins.z quantBins.w -p value -x cmpFilePath -o decFilePath
Options:
   -i oriFilePath: Path to the original data file
   -d dims.x dims.y dims.z: Dimensions of the original data, where dim.z is the fastest dimension.
   -b quantBins.x quantBins.y quantBins.z quantBins.w: Quantization bins for the 4 levels, where x is the base one and x<=y<=z<=w.
   -p value: Pooling threshold for a data block.
   -x cmpFilePath: Path to the compressed data file   (optional).
   -o decFilePath: Path to the decompressed data file (optional).
Examples:
   ./lsCOMP_uint32 -i data/cssi.bin -d 600 1813 1558 -b 3 5 10 15 -p 0.5
   ./lsCOMP_uint32 -i data/cssi.bin -d 600 1813 1558 -b 3 5 10 15 -p 0.5 -x data/cssi-cmp.bin
   ./lsCOMP_uint32 -i data/cssi.bin -d 600 1813 1558 -b 3 5 10 15 -p 0.5 -o data/cssi-dec.bin
   ./lsCOMP_uint32 -i data/cssi.bin -d 600 1813 1558 -b 3 5 10 15 -p 0.5 -x data/cssi-cmp.bin -o data/cssi-dec.bin
```
Note that lsCOMP supports configurable lossy modes, consisting of two steps: **Adaptive Scalar Quantization** and **Selective Pooling**.
You may choose to enable either step individually, enable both, or disable both (which makes lsCOMP operate in a lossless mode).
To disable Adaptive Scalar Quantization, set ```-b 1 1 1 1```; to disable Selective Pooling, set ```-p 1```.
More details about these algorithms can be found in the paper.

A sample output (lossless mode) can be found in the below:
```shell
$ ./lsCOMP_uint32 -i xpcs_500_2162_2068.uint32 -d 500 2162 2068 -b 1 1 1 1 -p 1
